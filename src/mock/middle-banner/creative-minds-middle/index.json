She simply placed the new floor over the original grey linoleum floor in case of the couple moving from the rental apartment. The Montana Mini modules in the colour Camomile bring rays of sunlight to Tekla's kitchen. Montana Mini is a series of uncomplicated, versatile storage modules. Available in three variants and only 10 colours, Montana Mini is the easier choice",
